# D2-dclone-notificator
This simple python script calls data from diablo2.io diablo clone progression tracker for all regions (non-ladder, softcore), displays the progression in real time (updated every 90 seconds), and raises an alarm (text and a beep) when the progression gets sufficiently high (4 or higher) on any of the regions. It also features a primitive anti-trolling system.

Please note that: May contain bugs!
